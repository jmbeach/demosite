##Description
This is a sample landing page I made to demonstrate my abilities in web design.
I made it when my sister sent me a picture of this site:

I did not visit that site at all and did not look at any similar code etc.
Everything I did was from intuition, photoshop, and whatnot.

I just want to add a professional looking site to my portfolio.
