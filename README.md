#Jared's Professional Landing Page
This is a sample landing page I made to demonstrate my abilities in web design.
I made it when my sister sent me a picture of this site: ![This site is what I was modeling it after](http://i.imgur.com/wlv2NgL.png)
I did not visit that site at all and did not look at any similar code etc.
Everything I did was from intuition, photoshop, and whatnot.j

I just want to add a professional looking site to my portfolio.
